    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Philadelphia has the greatest basketball scene in the country.
      Big 5. PCL. So many D2/D3 schools. Opportunities to watch basketball are endless.
      <br><br>
      The purpose of this site is to compile all the home games for local 
      college and high school teams, so you always know where you can
      catch a live basketball game in the Philadelphia area without
      having to browse the apps/websites for all the teams. Just click
      the events you want to attend, and copy it to your personal calendar.
      <br><br>
      Note: I'll try to be on top of any updates for schedule changes,
      but I'd recommend—especially for D3/High School—to double check
      the athletic websites before driving to the gym in case there 
      were any last-minute changes.
